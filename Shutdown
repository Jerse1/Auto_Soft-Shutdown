	Author: Merely
	Editor: Jerse;
	This system lets you shut down servers without losing a bunch of players.
	When game.OnClose is called, the script teleports everyone in the server
	into a reserved server.

	When the reserved servers start up, they wait a few seconds, and then
	send everyone back into the main place.
